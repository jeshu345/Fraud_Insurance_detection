# Fraud_Insurance_detection

🧠 Fraud Insurance Detection using Deep Learning
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent insurance claims using advanced Deep Learning techniques. It aims to help insurance companies detect anomalies and suspicious patterns in claim data, minimizing risk and financial losses.

🔍 Problem Statement
Insurance fraud can lead to significant financial damages. Traditional rule-based methods fail to catch complex or hidden frauds. This project leverages deep learning models to detect fraud based on various customer and claim-related features.

🚀 Key Features

-📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for identifying trends and outliers

-🧼 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering to prepare the dataset for model training

-🤖 Implemented LSTM and GRU-based Deep Learning Models for time-series and sequential pattern analysis

-📈 Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

-📉 Addressed overfitting by tuning models and keeping accuracy <95% for real-world generalization

🛠️ Tech Stack

-Python 3.x

-TensorFlow / Keras for building and training DL models

-Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn for data processing and visualization

-Sklearn for traditional ML comparisons and evaluation metrics
